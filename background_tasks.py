"""
Background task processing module for vehicle movement monitoring and alerts.

This module provides functionality for:
- Asynchronous movement tracking of vehicles
- Email alert management based on movement patterns
- Database state management for alerts and tracking
- Sophisticated movement pattern detection

Key Components:
- MovementChecker: Main class handling background movement checks
- Database connection management
- Email service integration
- Movement status determination with pattern recognition

The module uses threading for non-blocking background operations
and includes comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.
